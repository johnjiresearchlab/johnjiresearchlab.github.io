John Ji Research Lab is an interdisciplinary research group at Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, led by Associate Professor **John S. Ji**. Our research team is particularly interested in the **role of the environment on longevity and aging-related outcomes**. We hope our findings can influence design of urban environments to prevent disease and save lives.

Our research group uses **real-world evidence involving epidemiologic or occupational cohorts to examine the impact of environmental changes on population health**. We use exposure assessment tools such as earth satellite imagery, ground-based pollution monitors, and geographical information system to assess external exposure changes. Second, we use biological markers (aka biomarkers) as an indicator of biological processes or responses to environmental changes or pollution. Third, we use statistical techniques to quantify the association or causation of disease outcomes.
